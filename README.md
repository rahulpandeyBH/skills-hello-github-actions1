# Hello GitHub Actions

_Create and run a GitHub Actions workflow._

</header>

## Step 5: Trigger the workflow

_You've now added a fully functioning workflow to your repository! :smile:_

The shell script in the workflow will run whenever a new pull request is opened.

**Seeing your _action_ in action**: The status of each workflow run that's triggered is shown in the pull request before it's merged: look for **All checks have passed** when you try out the steps below. You can also see a list of all the workflows that are running, or have finished running, in the **Actions** tab of your repository. From there, you can click on each workflow run to view more details and access log files.

1. In your repo, click on the **Pull requests** tab.
1. Click on the pull request you created in step 1.-
1. Click **Merge pull request**, then click **Confirm merge**.
1. Optionally, click **Delete branch** to delete your `welcome-workflow` branch.
